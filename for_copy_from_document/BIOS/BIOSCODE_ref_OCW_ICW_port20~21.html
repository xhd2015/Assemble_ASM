<h4>Masking</h4>
Normally, reading from the data port returns the IMR register (see above), and writing to it sets the register. We can use this to set which IRQs should be ignored. For example, to disable IRQ 6 (floppy controller) from firing:
in ax, 0x21
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 6)
out 0x21, ax

<h4>In the same way, to disable IRQ 12 (mouse controller):</h4>
in ax, 0xA1
or ax, (1 &lt;&lt; 4)   ;IRQ 12 is actually IRQ 4 of PIC2
out 0xA1, ax

<h4>Remapping</h4>

Another common task, often performed during the initialization of an operating system, is remapping the PICs. That is, changing their internal vector offsets, thereby altering the interrupt numbers they send. The initial vector offset of PIC1 is 8, so it raises interrupt numbers 8 to 15. Unfortunately, some of the low 32 interrupts are used by the CPU for exceptions (divide-by-zero, page fault, etc.), causing a conflict between hardware and software interrupts. The usual solution to this is remapping the PIC1 to start at 32, and often the PIC2 right after it at 40. This requires a complete restart of the PICs, but is not actually too difficult, requiring just eight outs.

mov al, 0x11
out 0x20, al     ;restart PIC1
out 0xA0, al     ;restart PIC2

mov al, 0x20
out 0x21, al     ;PIC1 now starts at 32
mov al, 0x28
out 0xA1, al     ;PIC2 now starts at 40

mov al, 0x04
out 0x21, al     ;setup cascading
mov al, 0x02
out 0xA1, al

mov al, 0x01
out 0x21, al
out 0xA1, al     ;done!
